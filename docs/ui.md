# The watch page

`/` on the Worker is a read-only page. It never sends anything except the websocket `hello` and `GET` requests.

## Views

| Route | Shows |
|---|---|
| `#/` | **Activity**: every event, newest at the bottom, live. The sidebar's first item. |
| `#/project/<id>` | One project: kind, repo link, a line from its README, the file list Claude told Lite about, and its events. |

The **Projects** sidebar lists every project Lite has been told about (from `project.opened` events), each with its event count. It stacks above the main panel on a phone.

## Opening it with the token

The deployed Worker needs its token. Open the page once with the token in the fragment:

```
https://<worker>/#token=<your token>
```

The page keeps it in this browser's local storage and removes it from the address bar. The fragment is never sent to the server, and the token is never put in a query string. Without a valid token the page shows a **locked** card instead of the app.

## Theme

The pill in the top bar cycles **auto** (follows the system), **light** and **dark**; the choice is remembered in local storage. Panels are frosted glass (`backdrop-filter`) over soft colour; browsers without it get more opaque panels.

## How it is built

- `public/index.html` holds the markup and all styling, with fixed element ids the script renders into.
- `web/state.ts` is the pure state (events, projects, routes); `web/theme.ts` the theme logic. Both are unit tested.
- `web/page.ts` draws the state and reuses `cli/watch-core.ts` (the same reconnecting client `lite watch` uses) and `cli/format.ts`.
- `npm run build:web` bundles it to `public/page.js` with esbuild; `npm run deploy` does that and builds these docs first.
- Project details come from `GET /api/projects/<id>` (see [the API](api.md)).
